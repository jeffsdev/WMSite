  <h1>Didactic</h1>


<p>Say what? Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine.  He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.</p>
<h2>Hell Is Other Robots</h2>
<p>Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.</p>
<ul>
<li>I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.</li>
<li>Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</li>
<li>Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack!  I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bend Her</h3>
<p>You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Hello Morbo, how's the family? Oh God, what have I done? Who are those horrible orange men? Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!</p>
<h4>A Head in the Polls</h4>
<p>We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! It doesn't look so shiny to me. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!</p>
<ol>
<li>You guys go on without me! I'm going to go&hellip; look for more stuff to steal!</li>
<li>Why did you bring us here?</li>
<li>It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.</li>
</ol>
<h5>A Leela of Her Own</h5>
<p>Please, Don-Bot&hellip; look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! I never loved you. And until then, I can never die? Can we have Bender Burgers again? Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.</p>
