Didactic


Thank you for downloading Didactic! The license document has more legal information but I'd like to break it down as simply as possible here.

// CAN do with this:
Almost anything you can think of. Get paid for great designs using this font! Embed it in your iphone/ipad/android/mobile application. Create logos/brands for yourself or clients with this font. Tweak the font, make it unique to you!  

// CANâ€™T do with this:
Sell it and/or redistribute it. That's about it. Don't you dare link to the file download on your blog, website, social network. Just dont.

// SHOULD do with this:
Use it! 

// ENJOY:  Write hi@tylerfinck.com if you want to show me. Or tweet at @finck

I plan on continuing to refine the font and you will receive updated files as they become available. Thank you again for your support.
